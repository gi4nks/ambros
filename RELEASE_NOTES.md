## Ambros v3.1.0 - Incremental improvements

**Release Date**: September 14, 2025

This patch release focuses on polishing the interactive CLI, improving how commands are executed from interactive flows, and fixing a number of UX and safety issues discovered after the v3.0.0 rollout.

### Highlights
- interactive: improved TTY detection and safer interactive flows
- interactive: keep listing page after running a command and added local pagination
- run: new APIs `Execute` and `ExecuteCapture` to run commands and return exit codes/output without calling `os.Exit` (enables safe in-process execution from interactive flows)
- interactive: choice between streaming live output or capturing output for later viewing
- cleanup/manage: safer dry-run + explicit confirmation before deleting stored commands
- version: bumped embedded version to v3.1.0

### Notes for users
- If you use the interactive mode (`ambros interactive`), you will now be prompted whether to stream live output or capture and show output after running a command. Captured runs will display exit code and combined output without exiting the interactive session.
- Administrators: destructive operations performed via interactive cleanup require explicit confirmation and will show a dry-run list first.

### Download & Checksums
I built a macOS binary for this release locally and generated a SHA-256 checksum. You can reproduce the build locally using the Makefile or the following commands:

```bash
# Build (macOS):
GOOS=darwin GOARCH=$(uname -m) go build -o bin/ambros_v3.1.0 ./

# Compute SHA-256 checksum:
shasum -a 256 bin/ambros_v3.1.0
```

If you want, I can attach the artifact and checksum to the GitHub release (requires `gh` CLI or a PAT to upload via API).

## Ambros v3.1.1 - Patch release

**Release Date**: September 14, 2025

This patch release includes minor fixes and packaging updates following v3.1.0. Notable items:

- scripts: updated install helper usage and documentation to reference v3.1.1
- run: small cross-platform guard fixes and formatting cleanups
- docs: bumped embedded version and release notes

### Download & Checksums
Rebuild locally for reproducible binaries:

```bash
# Build (macOS):
GOOS=darwin GOARCH=$(uname -m) go build -o bin/ambros_v3.1.1 ./

# Compute SHA-256 checksum:
shasum -a 256 bin/ambros_v3.1.1
```

If you want, I can attach the binary and checksum to the GitHub release (requires `gh` CLI or a PAT to upload).

## Ambros v3.1.2 - Documentation update

**Release Date**: September 14, 2025

This patch updates documentation and installer helper references to point at the latest tag. No runtime behavior changes are included in this patch.

Highlights
- docs: bump embedded version file to v3.1.2
- scripts: update installer helper usage reference to v3.1.2

Small changelog
- Fixed a few typos in the README and RELEASE_NOTES
- Clarified install instructions and usage examples for macOS and Linux

If you want me to produce release artifacts (binaries + checksums) and attach them to the GitHub release, I can build and upload them next.
